# Gember Invoice

Gember Invoice is a plugin module for creating and calculating invoices in a Java/JVM environment. It is not a complete application for creating and sending complete invoices, however it is a sophisticated tool to do an essential part of the process, like Liquibase is a tool for maintaining database schema's.
Gember Invoice adheres to the invoicing rules for the EU Internal Market and does the (VAT-)calculations for invoices sent from and within the EU.

## Why Gember Invoice

As a student in my early years, it was about the mid of the 80's of the previous age, I was asked to create an application for creating invoices. Almost 30 years later I was asked to do the same trick again. Not in dBASE II this time, but in Java.
In the last 10 years of my professional live I did this trick at least 3 time during projects.
Since almost all e-commerce business logic needs a kind of invoicing, for me it seemed to be the right time to create an open-source invoicing module to do the most of the calculations.
